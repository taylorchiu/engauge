        	<p>EnGauge is a tool for teachers to monitor student engagement both during and after class, using a simple and easy-to-use dashboard that updates regularly. This app was created as the final project of a 12-week intensive coding course at General Assembly in San Francisco. The single page app consists of an AngularJS frontend, Coffeescript and Ruby on Rails backend, and a PostgreSQL database. Other technologies used were JQuery, Raphael, Angular UI for Bootstrap, Devise, and long-polling. EnGauge was constructed from scratch in one week.
